- learned and reviewed 300 words in Shanbay
- review the article *Multi-scale Features for Detection and Segmentation of Rocks in Mars Images*

  - features (local features: texture; object features: shading and two-dimensional shape; scene features: direction of illumination)
    - shape
      - residual error between the rock region's contour and its corresponding best-fit ellipse
      - convexity measurements: the ratio of the convex hull perimeter to the actual perimeter of the rock; the ratio of the convex hull area to the rock' s true area
      - region's circularity: the square of its perimeter divided by its area
    - texture
      - area-normalized histogram
      - $\chi^2$distance measure
    - shading
      - â€‹
